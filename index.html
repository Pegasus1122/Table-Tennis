    Playing table tennis is my favorite hobby. Table tennis is an easy-to-learn sport. In the beginning, it requires a lot of practice and patience but once you get better at it, table tennis becomes easy and fun. With every hit, you have to calculate the angle and how hard you should hit to make sure it reaches your opponent. Table tennis is a sport which doesnâ€™t require too much equipment and is not very tough to play. In the evening, I sometimes play table tennis with my dad and we have loads of fun. Table tennis is a very enjoyable sport and thus, is my favorite hobby.

    <p>My biggest table tennis inspiration is probably my dad. He used to be really good at table tennis when he was in college. He was the one who taught me how to play and practices with me daily. He encourages me to try my best and keep playing. My dad always has words of improvement after every game. After that, I try to improve and try not to make the same mistake. After playing table tennis with my dad for a few months, I think I have improved as a table tennis player.</p>
